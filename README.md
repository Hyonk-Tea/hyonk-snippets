# hyonk-snippets
a set of my python snippets that i use across various projects

# for langselect.py:
fyi you need to keep english.txt and norsk.txt at the same length!! otherwise if you try to print(lines[#]) and one of the files doesn't have that many lines, it will break when that line is called, with an `IndexError: list index out of range` error. 
there's probably a really easy way to fix this but i am not good at programming :3
